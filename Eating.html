<p>Cocker Spaniels are one of America’s favorite breeds. These sweet and cuddly dogs are a medium-sized breed. They have soft fur that is perfect for cuddling but they are also athletic and can be a fun, and playful partner.

Their coat is one of their most distinguishing qualities. With some extra grooming care and the proper nutrition, you’ll be snuggling up to these softies for many years to come.

Their long ears are another trademark. Originally used as sporting and hunting dogs, Cocker Spaniels are intelligent and easily trained.
